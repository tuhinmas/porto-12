# WELLCOME
This Laravel app is built for educational purposes and serves as part of my portfolio.

# What do I bring to the table?

🧩 Laravel Modules
We use modular architecture to make the app more organized, scalable, and easier to maintain.

🔐 JWT Authentication
Authentication is handled using JWT. Authorization is managed via Laravel policies to ensure secure access control.

🐳 Docker for Development
We use Docker to ensure a consistent development environment across all devices, making setup and collaboration smooth and reliable.

🚀 Simulated Production Environment
We simulate a production-like environment using:

- Nginx as the web server

- Laravel Octane with Swoole for high performance

- FrankenPHP for modern PHP runtime experimentation

- This helps us test the app under realistic deployment conditions.

📦 Importing Large Data
This app includes a simulation of large data import using both regular and optimized (fast) approaches. It's designed to compare and evaluate performance for different use cases.
